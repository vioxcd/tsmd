# Tab Session Manager Analysis

Trying to answer the question of "what I've been doing on [insert period of time]"; I think the question can easily be answered by looking at my browser history. Browser history are generated from using this [session-manager](https://github.com/sienori/Tab-Session-Manager) Firefox extension.

PS: I'm using a conda environment to do the analysis (hint: `rs` for my future self)
